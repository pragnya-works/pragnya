# Pragnya

> **Conscious Intelligence, Exceptional Products**

Pragnya is a wisdom-driven software agency that builds exceptional products through conscious intelligence. We architect resilient systems that scale from first principles, eliminating technical debt at the design phase.

## 🎯 Our Philosophy

### Architectural Sovereignty
We don't just ship features—we engineer systems. By maintaining strict architectural integrity, we ensure that every product we build is capable of evolving without the weight of inherited complexity.

### First-Principles Engineering
Pragnya is the application of deep technical intuition. We return to first principles to eliminate technical debt at the design phase, building lean, resilient foundations that outperform the status quo.

## 🚀 What We Do

We specialize in:

- **System Architecture**: Building scalable, resilient systems from the ground up
- **Technical Wisdom**: Applying deep engineering knowledge to solve complex problems
- **Product Development**: Creating high-impact products that users love
- **Engineering Excellence**: Maintaining the highest standards in code quality and design

## 💡 Our First Product: Edward

**Edward** is an autonomous engineering engine that bridges the gap between high-level architectural intent and production-ready code. It codifies technical wisdom to automate the heavy lifting of system design.

### Key Features:
- 🧠 **Intelligent Design**: Built with conscious architecture patterns for scalability and performance
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized at every layer to ensure lightning-fast interactions
- 🛡️ **Pragmatic Security**: Enterprise-grade security defaults out of the box
